# World of X

An interactive exploration of the world of Marvel's X-Men. Created in 1963, the X-Men have fought evil (and themselves) for over sixty years and across hundreds of comic book series, events, cartoons, and movies. With World Of X, you can explore the places that have shaped their world. Built using Meteor, World Of X incorporates the Google Maps API V3 and the Marvel Developer API.

## Local Setup
Running local set up will set up Meteor, install all necessary bundles and dependencies, and then run a server with livereload. It watches all SASS, JS, and images, then reloads accordingly.
    
    $ curl https://install.meteor.com | sh
    $ cd worldofx
