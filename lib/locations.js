			"content": "<p>A small island nation located north of the Seychelles off the east coast of Africa, Genosha was once known as “a green and pleasant land” for its high standard of living, an excellent economy led by advanced technology companies, freedom from the political and racial turmoil that characterized neighboring nations, and ample food and space for all. However, this apparent utopia was anything but, as Genosha’s entire socio-political economic infrastructure was built on the backs of its mutant population. Genoshan citizens were required to undergo genetic testing upon turning 13 years old, and those who tested positive with the mutant gene were, by law, property of the state.</p><p>Following Magneto’s threatening the world with another electro-magnetic pulse, Doctor Alda Huxley, a Genoshan expert on mutant sociopolitics, presented the United Nations with an alternative to retaliating against Magneto. Huxley suggested they cede him sovereignty of Genosha, with certain security restrictions, believing that the island’s turmoil would keep him occupied enough so as to not pose a threat to the rest of the world. Magneto agreed and set about establishing his new rule. Upon hearing of Magneto’s arrival on the island, many humans fled, rather than live under his authority.</p><p>Xavier’s genetic twin Cassandra Nova was responsible for unleashing giant Sentinel robots against Genosha, which decimated the island and its population. Seeking to atone for the sins of his twin, Xavier left the X-Men to assist the survivors in rebuilding the nation. Joined by Magneto, Xavier gathered a small band of heroes to aid in the reconstruction. When the mutant Scarlet Witch reshaped reality, a restored Genosha became the capital of Magneto’s global mutant empire. However, when she reverted the world to normal, not only was Genosha restored to its decimated state and the entire mutant population, including its leader, was turned into normal humans. SHIELD removed the last of the Genosha population for medical treatment, but Magneto remained. When they attempted to remove an unconscious Magneto from Genosha after his and the Avenger's encounter with the Collective, Magneto escaped.</p>",
